It is a pleasure to be re-awarded as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional
(MVP) 2018-2019 for Cloud and Datacenter category by Microsoft for my 3rd year
in a row.

It is definitely a great symbolic moment in my life that I am being appreciated
once again for the amount of contributions to Microsoft and Open Source
communities. This award is a memento of my dedication to digital technology and
sacrifices I have made to contribute improvements, innovations and knowledge to
others.

Most importantly, a big Thank You to my partner, new-born, family and friends
in putting up with my availability in their life for being a geek in the digital
world. Their sacrifices for me to pursue my dream in being a geeky hero in the
cyber space will not be forgotten.

Lastly, thank you to Microsoft, MVP Award programme team, fellow MVPs,
colleagues, followers and everyone else for their support. It is definitely an
honor and privilege to have your support and acknowledgement for me to be part
of a highly select group of experts just over 4000 globally annually that get
assessed annually.
